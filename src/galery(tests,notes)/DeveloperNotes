Some Variables like IShard;
built in same place with struct modules. not defined in Shard_manager for application security.

For Real Project:
-- Need subfunctions to optimize like delete for loops and define functions to return values in vecs
-- use threads to multiple processes
-- need task::spawn and control the Services for dynamic work
-- I just writed Services needs to control mechanism for microservice usage
-- So many control mechanism still need for real project
